1 - Apply Neumann/Dirichlet boundary conditions onto 2D code to simulate changing Pot/Fields and get forces/torque.

 (Code for this is ready in 3D_code.py, need to copy paste and debug for multiple microbots)


2 - Loop multiple iterations of positions in 2D_code.py to predict positions for multiple bots.

3 - Translate 2D_code.py into 3D based on 3D_code.py with boundary conditions and generate positions for multiple time steps.

4 - Animate changing fields/forces and positions in ParaView.
